BlenderRAD is a tool for the setup and execution of Radiance cases within Blender.

BlenderRAD is a derivative of the [BlendME](https://sites.google.com/site/opendesignsolutions/blendme) project for the specialisation of lighting design, rendering and analysis using Radiance from within Blender.

**Please be patient while we prepare for an initial release once the Blender API becomes stable after the release of v2.6.
